# Fuzzy logic-based student management system

The main purposes of assessment and evaluation are to evaluate the academic performance of students and to enhance their learning. The performance of students is evaluated using a range of conventional techniques. The conventional computation system, however, has many flaws. A number of strategies can be looked into, employed, and included in order to develop an efficient student performance analysis system. For instance, fuzzy logic, a method for adding human-like thought processes to a control system. This approach takes into account students' attendance, which is also thought to be a crucial grading factor. The fuzzy logic approach enables the user to incorporate subjectivity and uncertainty in the values if they so choose.
